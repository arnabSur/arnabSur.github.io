Hi!

I am a 1st year PhD student in Computer Science at Chennai Mathematical Institute. I am advised by <a href='www.cmi.ac.in/~sri'> B. Srivathsan</a>.

My research interests lie broadly in the field of Automata Theory and Verification. I am particularly interested in
* Timed Automata
* Concurrency Theory

## Work
I am currently continuing work on the topic of my Master's thesis, Integer Parameter Synthesis for Paramteric Timed Automata. You can find my thesis <a href='assets/pdf/msc-thesis.pdf'>here</a>. I am implementing my algorithms in <a href='https://github.com/arnabSur/tchecker'>TChecker</a>.

Additionally I am studying in Asynchronous Automata and in particular finding useful and practical subclasses of trace-closed languages, or properties of automata recognizing them, for which one construct small and simple asynchronous automata from the global automaton. Insights from this inquiry should help in extending this to the timed case.
