Hi!

I am a 1st year PhD student in Computer Science at Chennai Mathematical Institute. I am advised by <a href='https://cmi.ac.in/~sri'> B. Srivathsan</a>.

My research interests lie broadly in the field of Automata Theory and Verification. I am particularly interested in
* Timed Automata
* Concurrency Theory

# Work
I am currently continuing work on the topic of my Master's thesis, Integer Parameter Synthesis for Paramteric Timed Automata. You can find my thesis <a href='assets/pdf/msc-thesis.pdf'>here</a>. I am implementing my algorithms in <a href='https://github.com/arnabSur/tchecker'>TChecker</a>.

Additionally I am interested in Asynchronous Automata and in particular finding useful and practical subclasses of trace-closed languages for which one construct small and simple asynchronous automata from a global specification.
